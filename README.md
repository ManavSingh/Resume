# Resume
This is a .tex file of my Resume.
It can be opened and compiled using any LaTeX distribution. 
You will need to compile it using XeLaTeX.

It is called ResumeBold because it uses some text bolding to highlight points in my resume. See Resume for a version that uses bolding in a different manner.
